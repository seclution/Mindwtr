- **State**: Zustand (shared with mobile)
- **Platform**: Tauri v2 (Rust backend, WebKitGTK)
- **Drag & Drop**: @dnd-kit

### Why Tauri?
- 🚀 **Small binary** (~5MB vs ~150MB for Electron)
- 💾 **Low memory** (~50MB vs ~300MB for Electron)
- 🦀 **Rust backend** for fast file operations
- 🖥️ **Native dialogs** via system webview

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (for building Tauri)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (package manager)

### Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S rust webkit2gtk-4.1 base-devel
```

## Getting Started

```bash
# From monorepo root
bun install

# Run desktop app (dev mode)
cd apps/desktop
bun dev

# Or from root
bun desktop:dev
```

## Building

```bash
# Build for distribution
bun run build

# Output in src-tauri/target/release/
```

## Data Storage

Tasks are saved to:
- **Linux data**: `~/.local/share/mindwtr/data.json`
- **Linux config**: `~/.config/mindwtr/config.toml`

Desktop Settings → Sync → Local Data shows the exact paths for your OS. If you used very early builds, data may exist under legacy Tauri directories like `~/.config/tech.dongdongbh.mindwtr/` and `~/.local/share/tech.dongdongbh.mindwtr/` and will be migrated automatically.

## Sync

Configure sync in Settings:
- **File Sync** - Dropbox, Google Drive, Syncthing, etc.
- **WebDAV** - Nextcloud, ownCloud, self-hosted servers
- **Cloud** - Self-hosted cloud backend (see `../../docs/cloud-sync.md`)

## Testing

```bash
bun run test
```

Includes unit tests, component tests, and accessibility tests.
