## 🧠 Design Philosophy

Mindwtr is **simple by default and powerful when needed**. We focus on reducing cognitive load, cutting the fat, and keeping you in flow.

- **Progressive disclosure** keeps advanced controls out of sight until you need them.
- **Less by default** means fewer fields and fewer distractions.
- **Avoid feature creep** so the UI stays calm and purposeful.

*Don’t show me a cockpit when I just want to ride a bike.*
