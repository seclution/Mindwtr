# User Guide: Desktop

The Mindwtr desktop app is built with [Tauri v2](https://tauri.app/), providing a lightweight, fast experience across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Overview

The desktop app features a sidebar navigation with all GTD views and a main content area.

---

## Interaction Patterns

- **Single click** toggles task details.
- **Double click** opens full edit mode.
- **Right click** opens context menus (projects, tasks).
- **Keyboard first**: global shortcuts and Vim/Emacs modes are optimized for desktop workflows.

## Focus Mode

Use Focus Mode to hide the sidebar and keep the list centered (800px max width).

- Toggle with **Ctrl+\\** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+\\** (macOS)
- Great for deep work or reviews

### System Tray

Mindwtr runs in the background to handle auto-sync.

- **Closing the window** minimizes the app to the system tray instead of quitting.
- **Click the tray icon** to show/hide the window.
- **Right-click the tray icon** to Quit the application completely.
