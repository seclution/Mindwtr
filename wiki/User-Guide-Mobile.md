## Quick Capture

Mindwtr offers multiple ways to capture tasks quickly on mobile.

The capture screen is input-first. The syntax help is tucked behind a small “?” toggle to keep the interface clean.

### Share Sheet

Capture tasks from any app using the share sheet:

1. In any app (browser, email, notes), find something you want to capture
2. Tap the **Share** button
3. Select **Mindwtr** from the share options
4. The content is added to your Inbox automatically

Great for:
- Saving articles to read later
- Capturing emails as tasks
- Adding links from web browsing

### Home Widget

Add the Mindwtr widget to your home screen for quick access:

1. Long-press on your home screen
2. Select **Widgets**
3. Find and add the **Mindwtr** widget
4. Tap the widget to open quick capture or view focus items

### Quick-Add Syntax

Mindwtr parses natural language when adding tasks:

| Syntax       | Example           | Result             |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| `@context`   | `@home`           | Adds context       |
| `#tag`       | `#focused`        | Adds tag           |
| `+Project`   | `+HomeReno`       | Assigns to project |
| `+Multi Word` | `+New Project`    | Assigns to "New Project" |
| `!Area`       | `Plan roadmap !Work` | Assigns to area       |
| `/area:<name>` | `/area:Personal` | Assigns to area (no spaces) |
| `/due:date`  | `/due:friday`     | Sets due date      |
| `/note:text` | `/note:call back` | Adds description   |
| `/status`    | `/next`, `/waiting`, `/someday`, `/done`, `/archived`, `/inbox` | Sets status |

**Date formats:** today, tomorrow, friday, next week, in 3 days

## Focus

Your primary dashboard for doing.

### Sections

| Section      | Content                                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Today**    | Tasks focused for today, due today/overdue, or starting today           |
| **Next**     | Context-filtered actionable tasks ready to be picked up                 |

### Features

- **Context filter** — Tap a context chip to filter the Next list.
- **Swipe to Focus** — Swipe a task right to toggle "Focus" status (moves it to Today).
- **Quick Status** — Tap the status badge to change status.
- **Pomodoro (Optional)** — Enable in **Settings → GTD → Features → Pomodoro timer** to show a focus/break timer panel linked to your current task.

---

## Review

Review your tasks and update their status.

- See task details (description, start time, deadline, contexts)
- Quickly mark tasks as done
- Navigate between tasks
- **Select mode**: Batch select tasks and share them

---

## Task Editor (Task + View)

The task editor has two modes:

- **Task** — edit fields, checklists, dates, tags, contexts
- **View** — clean read-only summary with tappable checklist

Swipe left/right to switch between **Task** and **View**.

Checklist-first tasks default to View mode for faster checking.

The editor starts minimal. Tap **More options** to reveal advanced fields; any field with existing content stays visible.

Description markdown supports unordered lists and task checkboxes (`- item`, `[ ] item`, `[x] item`).
Markdown checkbox lines can populate checklist items when you save.

Recurring tasks support two strategies:
- **Strict** (fixed cadence)
- **Repeat after completion** (next date from completion time)

Use the recurrence field in the task editor, then toggle **Repeat after completion** when needed.

### Attachments

You can attach files or links to a task from the editor. Audio notes can be saved as attachments when **Save audio attachments** is enabled.

See [[Attachments]] for details on syncing and cleanup.

AI is optional and only runs when you request it.
