## Quick Capture

Mindwtr offers multiple ways to capture tasks quickly on mobile.

The capture screen is input-first. The syntax help is tucked behind a small “?” toggle to keep the interface clean.

### Share Sheet

Capture tasks from any app using the share sheet:

1. In any app (browser, email, notes), find something you want to capture
2. Tap the **Share** button
3. Select **Mindwtr** from the share options
4. The content is added to your Inbox automatically

Great for:

1. Long-press on your home screen
2. Select **Widgets**
3. Find and add the **Mindwtr** widget
4. Tap the widget to open quick capture or view focus items

### Quick-Add Syntax

Mindwtr parses natural language when adding tasks:

| Syntax       | Example           | Result             |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| `@context`   | `@home`           | Adds context       |
| `#tag`       | `#focused`        | Adds tag           |
| `+Project`   | `+HomeReno`       | Assigns to project |
| `+Multi Word`| `+New Project`    | Assigns to "New Project" |
| `/due:date`  | `/due:friday`     | Sets due date      |
| `/note:text` | `/note:call back` | Adds description   |
| `/status`    | `/next`, `/waiting` | Sets status      |

**Date formats:** today, tomorrow, friday, next week, in 3 days
