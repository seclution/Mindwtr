# Diagnostics and Logs

Mindwtr includes built-in diagnostics logging to help troubleshoot sync and crash issues. Logs are **local only**, and sensitive values are **redacted** before writing.

### Desktop
1. Open **Settings → Sync**
2. Toggle **Debug logging**

**Release diagnostics builds:** Devtools and extra logging are only available if the
desktop app was built with the `diagnostics` feature.

cd apps/desktop
cargo tauri build --features diagnostics
MINDWTR_DIAGNOSTICS=1 ./src-tauri/target/release/mindwtr
```

### Mobile

2. Toggle **Debug logging**
3. Reproduce the issue
