# Docker Deployment

Mindwtr provides official Docker support for running:
- **mindwtr-app**: The desktop web/PWA build, served by Nginx.
- **mindwtr-cloud**: The lightweight sync server.

These are available as Docker images and can be easily orchestrated using Docker Compose.

---

## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

The easiest way to get started is using the `compose.yaml` file included in the `docker/` directory of the repository.

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr.git
   cd Mindwtr
   ```

2. **Start the services**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml up --build -d
   ```

3. **Access the services**:
   - **PWA (Web App):** Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
   - **Cloud Health Check:** Open `http://localhost:8787/health`.

## Configuration

### Sync Token
The cloud server requires a token for authentication. You need to set this in the environment variables.

In `docker/compose.yaml` (or via environment variable), set:

```yaml
MINDWTR_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKENS=your_token_here
```

`MINDWTR_CLOUD_TOKEN` is still accepted for backward compatibility, but deprecated.

**Generating a Token:**
You can generate a strong random token using:
```bash
cat /dev/urandom | LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 50 | head -n 1
```

### Client Configuration
To connect your Mindwtr clients (Desktop or Mobile) to this self-hosted cloud:

1. Go to **Settings → Sync**.
2. Select **Self-Hosted** (or Cloud).
3. Set the **Self-Hosted URL** to your server's base endpoint:
   ```
   http://localhost:8787/v1
   ```
   *Mindwtr will automatically append `/data` to this URL.*
4. Enter the **same token** you configured in `MINDWTR_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKENS`.

### CORS Origin (Production)

The cloud server defaults to `http://localhost:5173` for CORS. For production, set:

```yaml
MINDWTR_CLOUD_CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-app-domain.example
```

---

## Data Persistence

To keep your cloud data safe across container restarts, you should mount a volume for the data directory.

In your `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./data:/app/cloud_data
```

---

## Building Manually

If you prefer to build the images yourself without Compose:

**Build PWA:**
```bash
docker build -f docker/app/Dockerfile -t mindwtr-app .
```

**Build Cloud Server:**
```bash
docker build -f docker/cloud/Dockerfile -t mindwtr-cloud .
```

---

## GitHub Actions & GHCR

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and pushes images to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

**Official Images:**
- `ghcr.io/dongdongbh/mindwtr-app:latest`
- `ghcr.io/dongdongbh/mindwtr-cloud:latest`

The `docker/compose.yaml` file is configured to use these images by default, making it easy to pull the latest version without building locally.

---

## Technical Notes

- **PWA Serving:** The web app uses client-side rendering. The Nginx container is configured with `try_files` to redirect all requests to `index.html`, preventing 404 errors on page refresh.
- **Base Image:** The build uses Bun (pinned to v1.3) and includes C++20 flags required for `better-sqlite3`.
