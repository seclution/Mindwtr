Frequently asked questions about Mindwtr.

---

## General

### What is Mindwtr?

Mindwtr is a cross-platform Getting Things Done (GTD) productivity app that helps you capture, clarify, organize, and engage with your tasks. Available for desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) and mobile (Android, iOS).

### Is Mindwtr free?

Yes! Mindwtr is open source and free to use under the AGPL-3.0 license.

### Is there a roadmap or upcoming features page?

We don’t maintain a fixed roadmap page. The living roadmap is the GitHub Issues list:
https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr/issues

If you have a feature request, please open an issue and describe the workflow you’re trying to support.

### Can I open multiple windows?

Not currently. The desktop app is single-window to keep the local-first SQLite data model safe and consistent. Multi-window support is a common request, but not available yet.

### Is there a donation page?

Yes — GitHub Sponsors: https://github.com/sponsors/dongdongbh

### What languages are supported?

Mindwtr currently supports:

- English
- 中文
- Español
- Deutsch
- 日本語
- हिन्दी
- العربية
- Русский
- Français
- Português
- 한국어
- Italiano
- Türkçe

### Where is my data stored?

All data is stored locally on your device:
- **Desktop data (Linux):** `~/.local/share/mindwtr/data.json`
- **Desktop config (Linux):** `~/.config/mindwtr/config.toml`
- **Windows/macOS:** `%APPDATA%/mindwtr/` or `~/Library/Application Support/mindwtr/`
- **Mobile:** Internal app storage

See [[Data and Sync]] for details.

### Is there cloud sync?

Mindwtr supports File Sync, WebDAV, and optional Cloud Sync. See [[Data and Sync]].

### How do I sync with OneDrive (especially on Android)?

Mindwtr already works with OneDrive **via file sync**:

- **Windows/macOS:** Put your Mindwtr `data.json` inside your OneDrive folder. OneDrive handles the sync automatically.
- **Android:** The official OneDrive app does **not** provide true two‑way folder sync.  
  Use a helper “bridge” app such as **OneSync (Autosync for OneDrive)** or **FolderSync** to keep a local folder synced.  
  Then point Mindwtr to that local folder in **Settings → Data & Sync** (Mindwtr uses `data.json` inside).

This is the same approach used by local‑first apps like Obsidian.

### Why doesn’t Mindwtr have a “Sign in with OneDrive / Google Drive” button?

Mindwtr is local‑first and offline‑first. Native cloud integrations require OAuth flows, token storage, and long‑term maintenance.
They also create strong pressure to add *every* provider (Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.).

File sync keeps your data in your control and avoids a large maintenance and security burden.

### Can Mindwtr integrate with email (Gmail/Outlook) or accept forwarded emails?

Not directly. Building a full email client requires:

- OAuth access to Gmail/Outlook (which now requires costly security audits)
- Robust MIME/HTML parsing and attachment handling
- Ongoing maintenance across providers

**Current alternatives:**
- **Desktop:** Paste `message://` or mail links in a task, or drag an email into a task note in clients that support it.
- **Mobile:** Use the share sheet to send selected email content into Mindwtr.

Mindwtr does **not** offer an `add@mindwtr.com` inbox because that would require a central server to receive and store your email.

## Features

### What is GTD?

Getting Things Done (GTD) is a productivity methodology created by David Allen. It consists of five steps: Capture, Clarify, Organize, Reflect, and Engage. See [[GTD Overview]].

### How do GTD Horizons map to Mindwtr?

Mindwtr natively models the lower horizons:

- **Horizon 0 (Actions):** Next Actions and task lists.
- **Horizon 1 (Projects):** Explicit Project entities.
- **Horizon 2 (Areas):** Areas group related projects.

For Horizons 3–5 (Goals, Vision, Purpose), there isn’t a dedicated entity yet. Most users track them with:

- A **Reference** list (or a “Goals” area)
- Project notes and links to those reference items
- The Weekly Review checklist

If you rely on explicit Goal/Vision objects, please open an issue with your desired workflow and review cadence.

### How do I enable Due Date, Priority, or Time Estimate?

These fields are hidden by default to keep the UI clean. Enable them here:

**Settings → GTD → Task Editor**

You can also reorder the fields there.



### How do recurring tasks work?

Mindwtr supports two recurrence strategies:

- **Strict** (fixed schedule): next date is based on the schedule pattern itself.
  Example: every 5 days stays on that cadence even if you complete late.
- **Repeat after completion** (fluid): next date is calculated from when you actually complete the task.
  Example: complete today, then next is due in 5 days from today.

Set recurrence in the task editor (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly), then enable **Repeat after completion** if you want fluid behavior.

### How do I collect logs for a bug report?

Logging is off by default. Enable it only when you want to report a bug.

**Desktop (Tauri):**
1. Go to **Settings → Sync → Diagnostics**.
2. Enable **Debug logging**.
3. Reproduce the issue.
4. Copy the **Log file** path and attach the file to your GitHub issue.

Linux log location (default): `~/.local/share/mindwtr/logs/mindwtr.log`

**Mobile:**
1. Go to **Settings → Data & Sync → Diagnostics**.
2. Enable **Debug logging**.
3. Reproduce the issue.
4. Tap **Share log** and attach it to your GitHub issue.

Logs are local-only and redact common credentials (passwords/tokens) before writing.

### Can I use natural language to add tasks?

Yes! Mindwtr supports quick-add syntax:
- `@context` — Add a context
- `#tag` — Add a tag
- `!Area` or `/area:<name>` — Assign to an area
- `/due:date` — Set due date (today, tomorrow, friday, next week, etc.)
- `/note:text` — Add description
- `/status` — Set status (`/next`, `/waiting`, `/someday`, `/done`, `/archived`, `/inbox`)
- `+ProjectName` — Assign to project

Example: `Call client /due:friday @phone`

### What are contexts?

Contexts are tags that indicate where or with what you can complete a task. Examples: `@home`, `@work`, `@phone`, `@computer`. Filter by context to see only tasks you can do right now. See [[Contexts and Tags]].

### How do I capture tasks quickly?

**Desktop:**
- Use the global hotkey to open quick-add from anywhere
- Click the tray icon for instant capture
- Type in any view's input field

**Mobile:**
- Use the share sheet to capture from any app
- Add the home widget for one-tap capture
- Use the Inbox tab input field

## Desktop

### What are the keyboard shortcuts?

Mindwtr supports Vim and Emacs keybinding presets. Press `?` (Vim) or `Ctrl-h` (Emacs) to see all shortcuts. See [[Desktop Keyboard Shortcuts]].

### How do I change the theme?

Go to Settings → Appearance. Choose Light, Dark, or System.

### How do I sync with my phone?

1. Configure a sync folder in Settings (point to Dropbox, Syncthing, etc.)
2. On mobile, select the sync folder in Settings → Data & Sync
3. Both platforms auto-sync on data changes and when switching apps

See [[Data and Sync]].

### Does it support notifications?

Yes! Mindwtr sends desktop notifications for:
- Due date reminders
- Start time alerts
- Recurring task reminders

You can snooze notifications for later.

**macOS** will prompt for permission the first time you enable notifications. On **Linux**, ensure a notification daemon is running.

## Mobile

### Which platforms are supported?

- **Android:** Full support via Google Play or APK download
- **iOS:** Available on the App Store and via TestFlight beta. Maintaining the App Store release still requires an annual Apple Developer fee, so sponsorship support helps keep iOS available.

### Why does editing feel different on desktop and mobile?

Mindwtr follows platform conventions:
- **Desktop:** single click toggles details, double click opens edit mode, and right click opens context menus.
- **Mobile:** single tap opens edit mode and swipe actions handle quick changes.

These patterns keep the app fast and familiar on each platform.

### How do I install on Android?

Install from Google Play or download the APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr/releases). Enable "Install from unknown sources" if prompted. See [[Mobile Installation]].

### How do I capture from other apps?

Use the **share sheet**! When viewing content in any app (browser, email, notes), tap Share and select Mindwtr. The content will be added to your Inbox.

### Is there a widget?

Yes! Add the Mindwtr widget to your home screen for quick capture and focus items.

### Is the AI assistant required?

No. The AI assistant is optional and off by default. Mindwtr works fully without it.
When enabled, it uses your own API key (BYOK). See [[AI Assistant]].

### How do swipe actions work?

In the Inbox, swipe right on a task to mark it as Done. Other views may have different swipe actions.

### How do I sync with desktop?

1. Export backup to your sync folder (Google Drive, Syncthing, etc.)
2. Select that folder in Settings → Data & Sync
3. The app auto-syncs on data changes and when going to background

See [[Data and Sync]].

### Does the mobile app send notifications?

Yes! Mindwtr sends push notifications for:
- Due date reminders
- Start time alerts
- Daily digest prompts
- Weekly review reminders

You can snooze notifications directly from the notification.  
Tapping the notification body opens the **Review** screen.

## Sync & Data

### Will I lose data if I sync?

No. Mindwtr uses Last-Write-Wins merge, keeping the most recent version of each item. Soft-deleted items sync properly across devices.

### Can I use multiple sync services?

We recommend using one sync folder to avoid conflicts. Pick one service (Dropbox, Google Drive, Syncthing) and use it consistently.

### How do I backup my data?

**Desktop:** Your data is in the data folder. Back up `data.json`.
**Mobile:** Use Export Backup in Settings to save a copy.

### Can I restore deleted tasks?

Soft-deleted tasks are not shown in the UI but remain in the data file briefly. There's no built-in undelete, but you could restore from a backup.

## Troubleshooting

### App won't start (Desktop Linux)

Ensure WebKitGTK is installed:
```bash
# Arch
sudo pacman -S webkit2gtk-4.1

# Debian/Ubuntu  
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0
```

### App crashes on startup (Mobile)

Try clearing app data:
1. Go to Settings → Apps → Mindwtr
2. Tap Storage → Clear Data
3. Reopen the app

Note: This deletes local data.

### Tasks aren't syncing

1. Check that sync folder is accessible
2. Verify sync service is running
3. Check file permissions
4. Try manual sync in Settings

### Notifications not working

**Desktop:**
- Check system notification settings
- Ensure app has notification permission

**Mobile:**
- Grant notification permission in device settings
- Check app notification settings
