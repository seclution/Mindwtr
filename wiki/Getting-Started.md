## First Launch

When you first open Mindwtr, you'll see the **Inbox** view. This is your capture zone.

### The Basic Workflow

1. **Capture** everything to the Inbox
2. **Clarify** each item using the processing wizard
3. **Organize** into Next Actions, Projects, or Someday/Maybe
4. **Reflect** during your Weekly Review
5. **Engage** with confidence

## Quick Add Syntax

Mindwtr supports natural language quick-add. Type directly in the task input:

| Syntax             | Example                    | Result                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `@context`         | `Buy milk @errands`        | Adds @errands context |
| `#tag`             | `Research topic #creative` | Adds #creative tag    |
| `+Project`         | `Call vendor +HomeReno`    | Assigns to project    |
| `+Multi Word`      | `+New Project Name`        | Assigns to "New Project Name" |
| `/due:date`        | `Report /due:friday`       | Sets due date         |
| `/note:text`       | `Task /note:remember X`    | Adds description      |
| `/status`          | `/next`, `/waiting`, `/done` | Sets status (also `/someday`, `/inbox`) |

**Date examples:**
- `/due:today`, `/due:tomorrow`
- `/due:friday`, `/due:next week`
- `/due:in 3 days`, `/due:2025-01-15`

**Escaping**
- Use a backslash to keep symbols as plain text: `\\@`, `\\#`, `\\+`, `\\/`
- Example: `Call \\@support /due:tomorrow` → title becomes `Call @support`

> **Tip:** You can also use **Audio Capture** to speak your tasks. Enable it in **Settings → AI Assistant** to use voice-to-text with smart parsing.
