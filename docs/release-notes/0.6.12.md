# Mindwtr 0.6.12

## Highlights
- Fixed a Play Store Android startup crash (`undefined is not a function`) caused by tab-bar path serialization in release builds.
- Added retry/backoff for Linux repo release-asset download to reduce transient GitHub API failures.

## Mobile
- Replaced the tab-bar rendering path on native to avoid release-only path serialization failures.
- Keeps quick capture behavior and tab navigation flow intact while preventing startup crash loops.

## CI
- Hardened `publish-repo` release asset download with retries when GitHub API returns transient failures (for example, HTTP 502).

## Full Change List (since 0.6.11)
- 3f36c34 ci: retry release asset download in publish-repo workflow
- 613758f fix(mobile): avoid release crash in tab bar path building
