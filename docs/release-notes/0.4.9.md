# Mindwtr v0.4.9

## Fixes
- Calendar: prevent old recurring ICS items with COUNT from resurfacing years later.
- Desktop (Windows): fix immediate app close by allowing the window close command in Tauri ACL.
- Desktop: allow WebDAV/ICS URLs that include explicit ports.

## Notes
- If you previously saw old recurring Google Calendar items (COUNT-based rules), re-import the calendar after updating.
