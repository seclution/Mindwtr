# Mindwtr 0.6.10

## Highlights
- Fixed a sync conflict edge case that could revert newer edits when revisions were equal, improving cross-device stability.
- Hardened the FOSS Android release flow for IzzyOnDroid/F-Droid: reproducible build behavior, permission cleanup, and plain npm + Gradle build docs.
- Improved review flow and board editing UX with clearer calendar review behavior and a more traditional board task edit modal.
- Polished desktop project/workflow UI with better layout structure, max-width handling, and divider-based list styling.

## Sync & Reliability
- Fixed revision tie-break logic to prefer newer timestamps before device-id ordering.
- Strengthened sync diagnostics and conflict reporting across tasks/projects/sections/areas.
- Continued hardening of attachment sync and local/remote merge behavior on desktop and mobile.

## Mobile
- Added @/# suggestion autocomplete with quick context/tag chips in task editing flows.
- Fixed iOS settings time picker behavior.
- Refined board and task editing interaction patterns.

## Desktop
- Refined project page structure (layout spacing, max-width constraints, alignment, and visual hierarchy).
- Expanded borderless divider-style list presentation to improve scaling for large task sets.

## FOSS / Distribution
- Added and validated an Izzy-compatible build recipe (`docs/izzyonandroid.yml`) using npm + Gradle (no Bun/EAS requirement).
- Added FOSS release checks and reproducibility hardening in mobile Android build scripts.
- Continued metadata/store listing updates for F-Droid/IzzyOnDroid and Microsoft Store.
