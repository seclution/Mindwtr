# Mindwtr 0.6.4

## Highlights
- Global Area filter (“hat switching”) across views, plus area assignment for standalone tasks.
- Duplicate projects on desktop for reusable checklists.
- Density/compact mode toggles and board layout refinements for better scanning.
- Mobile widget can complete tasks; inbox processing steps fixed.

## Desktop
- Add a global Area filter in the sidebar and reflect it throughout the UI.
- Duplicate projects from the sidebar (deep copy with fresh task state).
- Density toggle in list headers + keyboard shortcut; compact details label cleanup.
- Board view spacing + drag handle refinements.
- Replace discard confirm with a custom modal and improve review modal behavior.
- Enable native notifications.

## Mobile
- Widget now supports completing tasks.
- Fix inbox processing steps and layout overlap issues.
- Harden offline Whisper model download paths; request notification permission in standalone builds.

## Core & Data
- Focus view now respects start time; recurring tasks keep start times unset by default.
- Normalize timestamps on load and warn on FTS lock failures.
- Add REST API support for self-hosted sync.
