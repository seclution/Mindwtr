# Mindwtr 0.6.11

## Highlights
- Fixed Android startup stability issues seen in 0.6.10 Play builds (including `undefined is not a function` startup crashes).
- Fixed unintended startup navigation to Review caused by stale notification response replay.
- Hardened attachment cleanup + sync tombstone handling so audio attachment deletions propagate reliably across devices.
- Added area-based grouping for Reference items to improve organization at scale.

## Mobile
- Hardened startup provider flow to avoid runtime type errors during initialization.
- Prevented stale notification open payloads from forcing Review screen on app launch.
- Cleared last notification response after handling to avoid repeat deep-link behavior on restart.
- Hardened attachment cleanup helper resolution in mobile sync path.

## Sync & Data Integrity
- Preserved attachment tombstones during cleanup so deletions can sync correctly between devices.
- Separated file cleanup targets from metadata-tombstone retention behavior for safer cross-device cleanup.

## References
- Grouped Reference items by Area for cleaner categorization and browsing.
